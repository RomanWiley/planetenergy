Deploying Passport
When deploying Passport to your production servers for the first time, you will likely need to run the passport:keys command. This command generates the encryption keys Passport needs in order to generate access token. The generated keys are not typically kept in source control:

php artisan passport:keys
If necessary, you may define the path where Passport's keys should be loaded from. You may use the Passport::loadKeysFrom method to accomplish this:

/**
 * Register any authentication / authorization services.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function boot()
{
    $this->registerPolicies();

    Passport::routes();

    Passport::loadKeysFrom('/secret-keys/oauth');
}
